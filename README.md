# Pre-Work Study Guide

## Description

The main purpose of this project is to compile all my notes about the three languages of code I learned in the bootcamp.

I created this web app as practice for using the coding languages and skills I've learned thus far.

By compiling all my notes in one place I can switch interchangebally between studying the different languages without having to switch note sources.

So far, it contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript
